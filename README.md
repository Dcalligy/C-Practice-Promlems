# C++ Practice Promlems

I'm currently learning how to program using C++. 

The problem asked to write a menu program that lets the user select from a list of options, and if the input is not one of the options, reprint the list.

I used a do while loop to execute the body of the code at least once, allowing the user to enter the menu item; if the item is incorrect, the loop will repeat, prompting the user to select something that is on the menu until they enter a correct choice.
